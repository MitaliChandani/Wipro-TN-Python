'''
Write a Python program to decode a secret message from a text file.
The file contains multiple lines of text. Determine the meeting time based on the number of lines in the file:
If lines > 12, subtract 12 to get PM time.
Otherwise, itâ€™s AM time.
Also, find the most frequently occurring word in the file (ignoring case and punctuation).
Capitalize it and display it as the meeting place followed by 'Street'.
